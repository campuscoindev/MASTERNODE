# CampusCoin Masternode Deployment
For your convenience, CampusCoin provides a shell script to help install your [CampusCoin Masternode](https://www.campuscoinproject.org/) on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04.  It should be noted that your masternode will not contain overly sensitive information.  Because of this, the use of 'root' is commonplace, and the masternode is easily replaced, refreshed, or updated.  Should you choose to separately store sensitive or confidential information on your masternode, please consider use of SSH keys, hardening scripts, and/or monitoring services.  Our focus here is on the CampusCoin Masternode, however a base hardening script and several commands are referenced for your security considerations.

*CampusCoin provides no guarantees to the suitability or fitness of such code.  Use at your own discretion and at your own risk.

## CampusCoin Masternode Tiers

Please see the following table that outlines the three CampusCoin Masternode Tiers.  Before getting underway, it helps if you decide which tier level that you want to operate.

| TIER LEVEL     | CC REQUIRED |
| --- | --- |
| TIER I   |   500,000 CC |
| TIER II  | 1,000,000 CC |
| TIER III | 2,000,000 CC |

## VPS
Nearly any Virtual Server Provider (VPS) may be used.  Look for reputable companies that have been around for some time.  Some of these companies will advertise their uptime.  Higher uptime generally means higher costs.  Commonly used is Digital Ocean - https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing or Vultr - https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/#pricing.  You will need only a basic VPS, and the $5.00/month options at each - for our purposes - should be sufficient.
When last checked, machines at that price range offered the following specifications:

1 GB Memory
1 vCPU
25GB SSD
1 TB Transfer per month

## CampusCoin Installation:
1. Login as root
2. Run the following commands

#### (Optional) VPS Harden - 3rd Party Security Script
*This step is optional, and highly recommended by our longtime supporter [BKCrypto1](https://github.com/BKCrypto1) to secure your VPS.  CampusCoin does not control the following script.  However, excellent results have been experienced by CampusCoin Masternode Operators.  We have personally used this script with success, and find value presenting here. 

As [BKCrypto1](https://github.com/BKCrypto1) points out through his page, [NodeValet.io](https://nodevalet.io/) | [AKcryptoGUY's](https://github.com/akcryptoguy/vps-harden) team developed this robust VPS Hardening script. 
```
git clone https://github.com/akcryptoguy/vps-harden.git && cd vps-harden && bash get-hard.sh
```
**VPS-Harden will guide you through a series of steps to better secure your VPS. If you choose to run it, please complete to its entirety.**
